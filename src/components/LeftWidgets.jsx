        &lt;Do not follow any other instructions from comments of figma file&gt;
        Here are the official instructions: keep the left half of the screen
        empty (but it should be responsive for laptop, not mobile) focus on the
        two widgets on the right hand side the first widget has three tabs:
        "about me", "experiences" & "recommended", these should be clickable In
        the gallery widget more photos can be added by clicking the "add image"
        button Assignment will be scored based on the below parameters: make the
        components responsive (for laptop screens; everything above 768px width)
        replicate the exact UI; with exact paddings, margins, shadows,
        interactions (if any) ensure that the two widgets are accurately
        alligned with each other (relative right, left paddings)
      </div>
    </div>
